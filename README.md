## How to sign up for a bounty?

In order to participate in a bounty you need to **comment the issue** and provide a date when you plan to finish the bounty. The respective owner of the issue will confirm your assignment to the bounty and the table above will be updated accordingly.

## Keep the community updated!

You should provide at least a bi-weekly update of your progress in the issue of the bounty so that we know you are working on the bounty. It does not matter if the target date cannot be met for whatever reason as long as we see that work is being done. If you don't provide regular updates and you don't respond to questions in a reasonable time you are at risk to lose your bounty assignment!

_We reserve the right to assign the bounty to someone else in this case!_

## How to receive the reward?

To claim your bounty reward please provide your AE address (or .chain name) in the issue you solved after your contribution has been approved. The approval is either a merge of the PR in the official repository or an explicit comment in the issue of the bounty if there is no official repository in the organization. Make sure to include your *æternity wallet address* in the Github Issue to receive your reward. Bounties will be transferred in **AE tokens** and calculated based on CHF values right before payment. Transfers will be confirmed in the same Github Issue and may take up to 14 days.
